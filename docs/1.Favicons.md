# Part 1: generating your Favicon

## what the favicon....?
So what exactly is a favicon? When someone bookmarks a page, the computer will save the favicon as the image next to the name of the bookmark. People and organizations have been using favicons since 1999, and its why we know the logos of our favorite websites so well. If you go to [my personal webpage](https://ifueko.com), I like to use a cartoon verson of my future self that I made with Google Drawings ([more on that later...](3.Easy_Graphics)).


If you dont want to make your own favicon and are okay with using the [starter icon](../starter_template/icon/favicon.ico) which is a pink sun, then [feel free to skip to part 2.](2.Basic_Structure_And_Content)

## choosing a picture
To generate a favicon, you need to choose a picture. I (and lots of other people) believe that simple logos work best, and that while a high res initial picture is important, it will ultimately be downsampled to a really small size. For this tutorial, I'm making a personal website for an imaginary girl named serifina:

## converting the favicon
There are many resources that [a quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=favicon+generators+free) will show, but my favorite is [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). Its really simple to convert images, emojis, or even text into a simple favicon, and generate all the files you need for this tutorial. Using their PNG to ICO tool, I was able to convert my favicon to the required files and replace them in the `icon` folder.

Now that we've done that, lets [get some basic content on our page!](2.Basic_Structure_And_Content.md)
