# Part 5: dynamic content: links + iframes + javascript

When I say dynamic, I dont mean that you can never execute any code. In fact, if you can write something with javascript, it can run. However, this means no server side code, so you cant necessarily have things like a contact form or related things on your site.

# iframes
However, you can get around this if you can host it somewhere else. The cannonical example of this is a youtube video, which is embedded with an iframe. In this example, I embedded different websites within iframes within each carousel:

```
<div class="carousel-inner">
  <div class="carousel-item active">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <iframe class="d-block" src="https://justiceforbreonna.org/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="carousel-item">
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <iframe class="d-block" src="https://www.gofundme.com/f/elijah-mcclain/" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```


I also use this methodology on [my personal website](ifueko.com) to include a booking page, which I could probably not code easily using javascript:

```
<div class="container-fluid">
  <iframe id="booking-frame" class="media-frame" src="https://ifueko.simplybook.me/" title="Book Ifueko Now"></iframe>
</div>
```

There are also tools that do server-side code for you, and provide a javascript file you can include to do these things. Some are free, but have upgrades you need to pay for, such as the tool I use for my contact forms, [powr.io](https://www.powr.io/), which also does alot of other cool things for small businesses.
