# Part 5: graphics

## graphics for the non-graphic designer
If you can afford a graphic designer, make the investment. However, if you have a few hours to spare and are willing to style your pages to compensate for simple graphics, look no further! We are going to combine free stock photos as well as drawings made in any shape + paint editor (I'm using Google Drawings)
