# Part 0: understanding the starter template development environment and file structure


## introduction
In this tutorial, we're going to be focusing on **static** pages using basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. No PHP, Python, or anything server side (send me a message if anyone is interested in a cheap web deployment tutorial for dynamic content!) If you are unfamiliar with any of these technologies, here ae some useful resources:

[HTML: W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

[CSS: W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

[JS: W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

W3 schools is great for OG web programming tools. While many things have been improved in terms of available APIs and enhancement with things like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), the basics are still the same, and with the libraries we will be using, this is all you *really* need to know.

## file structure
Our [starter template](starter_template) contains the basic structure for our application. Lets talk components:

### index.html

This is the page that will be rendered at the home of any website. This is the page that most sites will navigate to if a specific HTML, PHP or other type of file is not provided. Notice that (*as recent as july 2020*) [www.google.com](www.google.com) and [www.google.com/index.html](www.google.com/index.html) navigate to the same page. Using GitHub Pages and our custom domain, this is the page that our personal website will be displayed. We can link to other pages ([more on that to come](7.Dynamic_Content.md)) and they will also display just fine.

### css folder
This is where we store style sheets. We only need a single style sheet to define our custom look and feel, which we name index.css here, but it is quite simple to add additional styles ([more on that to come](4.CSS_Basics.md)). We also start with the [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) core css and [aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) core css, which we need for our application.

### js folder
This is where we store our javascript code. Currently, we start with [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [aos](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), which are all basic requirements for our application.

### img folder
This is where we like to store images that we plan to use on the site.

### icon folder
This is where we store our favicon information for personal branding. We wont touch this too much, but its nice to know where we need to put things.

#### Lets go!
Now that we kinda understand whats going on, [lets make talk about my favorite part of a website, the favicon...](1.Favicons.md)
